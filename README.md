Euler Project
=======

This is a hobby project where I've decided to take on completing the problems on the 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) web site. Feel free to take a look at the
problems that I've implemented here in Scala; however, you may want to try your hand at
the problems yourself before looking at my solutions.
